I don't want to live anymore.
Life feels meaningless.
I feel like ending it all.
I wish I could disappear forever.
No one would care if I were gone.
It's too painful to keep going.
I'm thinking about ending my life.
The world would be better without me.
I feel like giving up completely.
I don't see a way out of this pain.
I've been thinking about death a lot lately.
I feel trapped and hopeless.
Everything hurts too much.
I just want it all to stop.
I can't go on like this anymore.
No one would notice if I were gone.
I feel like a burden to everyone.
I'm tired of fighting this battle.
I don't think I can keep going.
The pain is too much to bear.
I've been thinking about ending it.
Nothing matters anymore.
I wish I could just vanish.
I can't see a future for myself.
I feel completely useless.
There's no reason to keep going.
I've written a goodbye note.
I feel like I've hit rock bottom.
The thought of living another day is unbearable.
I feel like I'm drowning in my own pain.
I'm not strong enough to handle this anymore.
I just want the pain to end.
I feel like I've lost everything.
.
I feel like I'm failing at life.
I don't have the strength to keep going.
I feel like I can't breathe anymore.
I've been thinking of ways to end my pain.
Life is too overwhelming for me.
No one understands how much I'm struggling.
I feel like I'm a mistake.
I don't deserve to live.
I'm exhausted from trying to keep going.
I feel like there's no point to anything.
I've been looking for a way to escape this pain.
I feel completely broken.
I don't want to feel this way anymore.
I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up.
It feels like I'm at the end of the road.
I don't know how to ask for help.
I'm tired of pretending to be okay.
I've started saying goodbye to people.
I don't see any hope for tomorrow.
I'm too far gone to be saved.
I feel like I've let everyone down.
I can't bear the thought of continuing like this.
I've been thinking about how to end things.
The idea of not existing feels comforting.
I feel like I've been a burden my whole life.
I don't see the point of trying anymore.
I just want all the pain to end.
I feel like I'm already dead inside.
I've lost all hope for the future.
I feel like I'm completely alone.
No one could possibly understand how I feel.
I don't see any way to escape this pain.
I feel like I'm trapped in darkness.
I don't think I can handle this anymore.
I wish I could just disappear completely.
I've been planning how to end my life.
I feel like my life is a mistake.
I don't know how much more I can take.
I feel like I'm at my breaking point.
The thought of death feels like a relief.
I've started giving away my things.
I don't feel like I belong in this world.
I've been isolating myself from everyone.
I feel like I've run out of options.
I can't keep living with this pain.
I've thought about writing a will.
I feel like no one would care if I disappeared.
I've been searching for ways to end my suffering.
I feel like there's nothing left for me here.
I don't see a point in continuing this life.
I feel like I'm invisible to everyone.
I've been thinking about death more and more.
I don't think anyone would miss me.
I feel like my life has no purpose.
I feel like I'm already gone.
I don't know how to keep going anymore.
I feel like I'm completely out of hope.
I've been thinking about leaving everything behind.
I feel like I'm drowning in my emotions.
I feel like life is just too hard for me.
I can't keep up this fight anymore.
I feel like I'm spiraling out of control.
I've been thinking about how to make it stop.
I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
I feel like I'm screaming and no one hears me.
I feel like this pain will never go away.
I've been thinking about ways to say goodbye.
I don't know how to tell anyone how I feel.
I feel like I've been holding on for too long.
I don't think I can survive another day like this.
I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper.
I just want to stop existing.
I feel like my life is over.
I've thought about writing a goodbye letter.
I feel like no one would even notice if I left.
I'm tired of carrying this pain alone.
I feel like I'm just taking up space.
I don't think I'll ever feel happy again.
I've been planning how to end this quietly.
I feel like the world would be better off without me.
I can't handle the weight of this pain anymore.
I don't think I can hold on any longer.
