Depression
I'm sad

Feeling down today

Nothing feels right anymore

Everything seems pointless

Life feels heavy

Happiness feels out of reach

It's hard to find joy

Crying without knowing why

Feeling like a burden

Nothing excites me anymore

Sadness takes over every moment

Tears just won't stop

Life feels empty and dull

I feel so tired all the time

I can't stop feeling hopeless

Getting out of bed feels impossible

Nothing makes sense anymore

The world feels so distant

It's hard to find any reason to smile

Joy feels like a distant memory

I just feel broken inside

The days all feel the same

I have no energy to keep going

It's like I've lost who I am

I feel so numb

Life has no meaning anymore

I feel like crying all the time

I just want to stay in bed forever

I can't stop feeling worthless

The sadness is too much to bear

I feel lost and confused

Even simple things feel hard now

I don't enjoy my favorite things anymore

The joy of life has disappeared

I feel like a shadow of my former self

The weight of sadness is overwhelming

I can't bring myself to smile

There's no excitement in life anymore

Hobbies don't bring me joy anymore

It's hard to keep going every day

Even good things feel meaningless

I feel like I've let everyone down

The future feels hopeless

Nothing feels worth it anymore

I feel like I don't matter

The world feels cold and distant

It's hard to explain this pain inside

Every moment feels like a struggle

There's no light at the end of the tunnel

I don't see any way out of this

Life feels like a heavy burden

The sadness never seems to go away

It feels like I'm fading away

I just don't care about anything anymore

I feel like I've lost all purpose

It's hard to face the world every day

The good times feel so far away

Every step feels like climbing a mountain

I feel so disconnected from everyone

It's like I'm stuck in a fog I can't escape

I feel like I'm falling apart

The weight of life is too much to handle

The sadness is crushing

I can't find the energy to do anything

The days drag on endlessly

I feel so alone in the world

There's no strength left in me

The sadness feels suffocating

Every task feels like a massive effort

The joy of life is gone

There's no peace inside me

Happiness feels unattainable

It's hard to imagine feeling better

Every moment feels heavy and dark

Even the sun feels cold to me

The sadness is overwhelming my life

I feel like I'm stuck in this darkness forever

The tears just keep coming

Nothing feels real anymore

The future feels so bleak and empty

There's no escape from this sadness

Even food doesn't taste the same anymore

I feel so distant from everyone around me

Every smile feels fake

There's no joy in my heart

The days are so hard to get through

I don't even know what I feel anymore

The sadness feels endless

Every breath feels like a struggle

I feel like I'm drowning in my own sadness

It's hard to find a reason to get up in the morning

Even laughter feels hollow

The world seems gray and lifeless

I feel like I'm disappearing piece by piece

It's like carrying a heavy weight everywhere

I don't feel connected to life anymore

Every minute feels like an eternity

I feel trapped in my own sadness

The good times feel like a dream

There's no hope left in my heart

I'm sad

Feeling down today

Nothing feels right anymore

Everything seems pointless

Life feels heavy

Happiness feels out of reach

It's hard to find joy

Crying without knowing why

Feeling like a burden

Nothing excites me anymore

Sadness takes over every moment
