I feel nervous all the time

My mind keeps racing, and I can't focus

I feel like something bad is going to happen

It's hard to catch my breath when I feel this way

I can't stop worrying, even when there's no reason

I feel on edge and restless

My chest feels tight when I get anxious

I struggle to relax, even when I try

I can't stop thinking about the worst-case scenario

I get easily overwhelmed by small things

I feel shaky and unsettled

I often feel like I'm losing control

I can't stop overthinking everything

My hands get sweaty when I feel anxious

I feel like I need to escape but don't know where to go

I often feel like I'm under too much pressure

I feel like I'm constantly being judged

I feel like there's not enough time to get everything done

I wake up feeling anxious for no reason

I feel tense and can't seem to calm down

I feel like I'm always on high alert

I often get headaches from all the worrying

I feel lightheaded when my anxiety gets bad

I can't stop checking things over and over

I often feel overwhelmed by social situations

I avoid certain places because they make me anxious

I feel like my heart is racing for no reason

I get anxious thinking about the future

I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of worry

I feel like my anxiety is taking over my life

I often feel like people are watching me

I feel like I can't cope with everyday situations

I often feel like I'm not good enough

I worry about things that probably won't happen

I feel like I'm carrying a constant weight of worry

I feel like my thoughts are spinning out of control

I feel anxious when I'm around large crowds

I get anxious before meeting new people

I often feel like I can't control my emotions

I feel like I'm always running out of time

I get anxious thinking about past mistakes

I feel like I'm constantly overthinking everything

I often feel anxious when I'm away from home

I get nervous when I have to make decisions

I often feel like my anxiety affects my relationships

I feel like I'm always bracing for something bad to happen

I can't stop fidgeting when I feel anxious

I feel like I can't escape my own thoughts

I often feel like I'm failing at managing my anxiety

I feel like my body is in a constant state of tension

I feel like I can't focus on the present moment

I feel like I'm trapped by my own fears

I feel like I'm constantly second-guessing myself

I feel like I'm always expecting the worst

I feel like my anxiety is holding me back

I often feel anxious when things are out of my control

I feel like I'm always trying to avoid conflict

I feel like I'm struggling to keep it together

I feel like I'm stuck in my own head

I feel like my anxiety makes me overanalyze everything

I feel like my mind is running a marathon

I feel like I can't switch off my thoughts

I feel anxious about things I can't change

I feel like I'm not capable of handling stress

I often feel like I'm drowning in my thoughts

I feel like I'm always trying to meet impossible expectations

I feel like my anxiety is taking over my body

I feel like I'm constantly on the edge of panic

I often feel like my thoughts are too much to handle

I feel like I'm always preparing for the worst

I feel like my mind won't give me a break

I feel like I'm always afraid of making mistakes

I feel like my anxiety keeps me from enjoying life

I feel like I'm always worrying about what others think

I feel like I can't slow down my racing mind

I feel like my anxiety makes small tasks feel impossible

I feel like I'm always overanalyzing everything

I feel like I'm carrying too much mental weight

I feel like my anxiety keeps me in a constant state of fear

I feel like I'm always second-guessing my choices

I feel like I'm constantly afraid of failure

I feel like my anxiety controls my daily life

I feel like I'm always waiting for something to go wrong

I feel like my anxiety is draining my energy

I feel like I'm always worrying about the unknown

I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of fear and worry

I feel like my anxiety makes me avoid new experiences

I feel like I'm constantly questioning my actions

I feel like my anxiety prevents me from relaxing
